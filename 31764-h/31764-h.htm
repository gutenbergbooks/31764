<span class="i0">O lyrist of the lowly and the true,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The song I sought for you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hides yet unsung. What hope for me to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Lost in the d√¶dal mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living utterance with lovely tongue!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To say, as erst was sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Ariosto of Knight-errantry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Through lands of Poesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song's Paladin, knight of the dream and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The wizard shield you sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that Atlantes power, sweet and terse,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The skyey-builded verse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shield that dazzles, brilliant with surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Our unanointed eyes.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, had I written as 't were worthy you,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Each line, a spark of dew,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As once Ferdusi shone in Persia,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Had strung each rosy spray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the unfolding flower of each song;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And Iran's bulbul tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sobbed its heart out o'er the fountain's slab<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In gardens of Afrasiab.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hunting one day, by some unwonted freak<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Rode parted from his retinue and gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chase to an antelope. Without or slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amir or vizier to a pasture place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sheep he came, where dark, in tattered grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watched one, an Arab youth. And as it came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The antelope drew off, with mouth of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tongue of fire to the youth he turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting, "Ho! fellow! in what school hast learned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seest not the buck escapes me? worthless one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O desert dullard!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">Rising in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O ignorant," he said, "of that just worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those the worthy of our Muslim earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that thou look'st upon me&mdash;what thou art!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one fit for contempt, thou lack'st no part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my disdain?&mdash;Allah! I would not own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog of thine for friend no other known&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of speech a tyrant, manners of an ass!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flung him, rags and rage, into the grass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Provoked, astonished, wrinkled angrily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hissed Hisham, "Slave! thou know'st me not I see!"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Calmly the youth, "Aye, verily I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mannerless! thy tongue hath told me so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy tongue commanding ere it spake me <i>peace</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon art thou known, nor late may knowledge cease."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O dog! I am thy Khalif! by a hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy life hangs rav'ling."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"May it dangle there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou art rotted!&mdash;Whiles, upon thy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misfortunes shower!&mdash;Of his dwelling place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allah, be thou forgetful!&mdash;What! his grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hisham ben Merwan, king of many words&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few generosities!"...<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">A flash of swords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In drifts of dust and lo! the Khalif's troops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounding ride. As when a merlin stoops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some stranger quarry, prey that swims the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heron or eagle; kenning not its kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There whence 'tis cast until it, towering, feels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eagle's tearing talons, falling reels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In broken circles downward&mdash;so the youth,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
<span class="i0">An Arab fearless as the face of Truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that made him instant of his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waited with eyes indifferent, equal breath.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The palace reached, "Bring in the prisoner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the Khalif," and he came as were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He in no wise concerned: unquestioning went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chin bowed on breast, and on his feet a bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark gaze of scornful freedom unafraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at the Khalif's throne his steps were staid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unsaluting, standing head held down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An armed attendant blazed him with a frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dog of the Bedouins! thy eyes rot out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insulter! must the whole big world needs shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Commander of the Faithful,' so thou see?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To him the Arab sneering, "Verily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Packsaddle of an ass."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">The Khalif's rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeded now, and, "By my realm and rage!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arab, thy hour is come, thy very last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hope is vanished and thy life is past."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd answered, "Aye?&mdash;by Allah, then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Hisham, if my time be stretched again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unscissored of what Destiny ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little or great, thy words give little pain."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the chief Chamberlain, "O vilest one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the Arabs! wilt thou not be done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bandying thy baseness with the Ruler of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Faithful?" spat upon his face. A scoff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiery made answer:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"There be some have heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nonsense of our God, the text absurd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'One day each soul whatever shall be prompt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bow before me and to give accompt.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then wroth indeed was Hisham; hotly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He braves us!&mdash;headsman, ho! his peevish head!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See; canst thou medicine its speech anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doctor its multiplying words to few;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divorce them well." So, where the Arab stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound him; made kneel upon the cloth of blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With curving sword the headsman leaned at pause,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, even as 'tis custom made of laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the descendant of the Prophet quoth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Khalif, shall I strike?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">"By Iblis' oath!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike!" answered Hisham; but again the slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questioned; and yet again the Khalif gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nodded "yea"; and for the third time then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He asked&mdash;and knowing neither men nor Jinn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might save him if the Khalif spake assent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signalled the sword, the youth with body bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed&mdash;till the wang-teeth of each jaw appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed&mdash;as with scorn the King of kings he 'd beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insulting death. So, with redoubled spleen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared Hisham rising, "It is truly seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou art mad who mockest Azrael!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Arab answered: "Listen!&mdash;Once befell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commander of the Faithful, that a hawk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hungry hawk, pounced on a sparrow-cock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winging nestward with his meal in claw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him the sparrow, for the creature saw<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The hawk's conceit, addressed this slyly, 'Oh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most great, most royal, there is not, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in me which will stay thy stomach's stress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am too paltry for thy mightiness';<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which the hawk was pleased, and flattered so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his self-praise, he let the sparrow go."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then smiled the Khalif Hisham; and a sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staying the scimitar, that hung malign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A threatening crescent, said, "God bless, preserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prophet whom all true believers serve!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by my kinship to the Prophet, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he at first but spake us thus this hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ne'er been reckless, and instead of hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had had all&mdash;except the Khalifate."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade stuff his mouth with jewels and entreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him courteously, then from the palace beat.<br /></span>
